## Monday: Protostars, Very Young Stars, Young Stars

### Disks and Young Planets: A Roadmap for the Workshop

- [Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP)](https://almascience.eso.org/almadata/lp/DSHARP/)

### [The First 3 Myr: Protostars and Protoplanetary Disks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNyIF2JWUt4&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=30)
- Young stellar object (YSO) < 3 Myr
- Ages of protostars are inferred from the net ratios of objects expected from modeling super systems
- Protostar bursting rate is on order of decades and frequency on millenia

### [The Next 100 Myrs: Young Moving Groups and Associations: Surveys and Membership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zexmgd8tFlM&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=31)
- Sparse groups of coevolved starts are dispersed by galactic potential after 100 Myr, appearing random. Open clusters are bound for longer times
- YSOs within 60 pc don't exist, so must move to 500 pc with less resolving power
- Sun is close to the AB Doradus moving group which appears randomly distributed across the sky because it is close. This is detectable by flattening the field of view from Earth against background stars. The motion can be inferred to converge to likely source cluster.
- [BANYAN &Sigma;](http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/banyan/) tool for calculating likelihood of association from position and velocity over time
- Moving groups may be part of the tidal tails of larger structures. Columba and Carina moving groups for example.
- Association and kinematic data are so far not structured well

### Summary and Discussion: Determination of Stellar Properties from Observations and Models, Classifications of Young Stars
- [Determining Stellar Properties of Young Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lizFKZIaz9k&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=23)
- Accuracy of spectroscopic analysis 
  - See [NSO Solar Atlas](https://nso.edu/data/historical-archive/)
  - Stellar magnetic field must be determined because it biases spectra except for molecular signals. Optical star studies account for only the hot mass of a star.
- [Determination of Stellar Properties: The Modeler's Point of View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Fw4H0MJLsA&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=15)
- Challenges of Modeling Young Stars. Accumulation of errors causes modelling problems. 
  - Benchmark systems confirm the accuracy of model prediction, with mass and metallicity as inputs.
  - Accretion history leading to idiosyncratic events like axis tilt of Uranus. "Outburst events" at boundary layers present major errors in models.
  - Nonequilibrium chemistry characterizes the accretion disks
  - Stellar luminosity changes lead to misclassification on HRD and radiation bursts agains forming planets, stripping water, atmospheres

## Tuesday: Primordial, Planet-Forming Disks and Disk Structure

### Summary and Discussion: Techniques, Observations, and Diagnostics of Protoplanetary Disks: Inner Disk and Outer Disk
- [Techniques, Observations, and Diagnostics of Protoplanetary Disks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DubszdHuARY&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=3)
  - Matter in inner disks are guided by B-field lines, accrete on to a stellar surface, radiate, and which is absorbed and re-emitted with molecular absorption lines
  - Can infer radius of disks from angular velocities of emitters in a disk 
  - Dippers are dramatic drops in stellar flux likely due to misaligned disks or density in accretion clouds around the system
- [Techniques, Observations, and Diagnostics of Outer Disks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tflanKnwtY&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=19)
  - Spectral index values correlate to disk dust grain size
  - Disk alignment with the plane of the system can vary, which is detectable by occlusion of the star
  - Local perturbations are caused by gravity of bodies in the system, deviating from Keplerian gravity
  - Lit review

### [Gas and Chemistry in Protoplanetary Disks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUtH82QAd6A&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=2)
- Snowlines, radius at which energy causes phase change, alters the ratios of elements observable at different points in the disk by freezing out molecules from combined gasses
- Boundary layers in disks are at chemical equilibrium, points in the disk and disk atmosphere at steady states because of unavailable energies needed to transition between chemical configurations
- Disk composition is diverse across a single disk *and* between many disks

### [Dust Grain Evolution: From Sub-micron Grains to Pebbles to Planetesimals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSGR369WsKE&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=17)
- Stokes number defines the coupling of a solid to the gas of a disk, i.e. large bodies are less coupled to the fluid
- Gas and solids are dominated by Keplerian velocities, but the raditative pressure component is signficant to gasses as well. Large particles drift 'up' the pressure gradient.

### [Structures in Disks and Planet-Disk Interactions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvJWVzv6XY0&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=20)
- Substructures can be created by planets in a disk, or by non-smooth initial conditions
- Rings, for example, can be caused by planet formation, but a ring line is not a predictor of a single planet, so presence must be confirmed by imaging of the planet near the ring

### [Summary and Discussion: Debris Disks as Planetary Signposts (Theory and Observations)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpjTGpTN4eM&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=12)
- Modelling debris as N-bodies, or in aggregate in phase space
- Motion resonances due to multiple large bodies cause clumping in debris
- Systems with lots of interaction near the star are cleared of dust through destructive collisions

### [Debris Disks as Planetary Signposts (Observations)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN0TBcN2oRk&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=12)
- Space-based observations remove dominance of stellar irradiance by subtracting a reference star from the field of view
- Earth-based observations with removal of irradiance and adaptive optics
- Tracer of a planetary system is the ratio of infrared luminosity to stellar luminosity. IR fractional luminosity is proportional to the number of grains

### Panel Discussion: Disk Dissipation
- Dissipation has been observed at very short and long time scales.
