# Sagan Summer Workshop 2021

## Monday: Protostars, Very Young Stars, Young Stars

### Disks and Young Planets: A Roadmap for the Workshop

- [Disk Substructures at High Angular Resolution Project (DSHARP)](https://almascience.eso.org/almadata/lp/DSHARP/)

### The First 3 Myr: Protostars and Protoplanetary Disks
- Young stellar object (YSO) < 3 Myr
- Ages of protostars are inferred from the net ratios of objects expected from modeling super systems
- Protostar bursting rate is on order of decades and frequency on millenia

### The Next 100 Myrs: Young Moving Groups and Associations: Surveys and Membership
- Sparse groups of coevolved starts are dispersed by galactic potential after 100 Myr, appearing random. Open clusters are bound for longer times
- YSOs within 60 pc don't exist, so must move to 500 pc with less resolving power
- Sun is close to the AB Doradus moving group which appears randomly distributed across the sky because it is close. This is detectable by flattening the field of view from Earth against background stars. The motion can be inferred to converge to likely source cluster.
- [BANYAN &Sigma;](http://www.exoplanetes.umontreal.ca/banyan/) tool for calculating likelihood of association from position and velocity over time
- Moving groups may be part of the tidal tails of larger structures. Columba and Carina moving groups for example.
- Association and kinematic data are so far not structured well

### Summary and Discussion: Determination of Stellar Properties from Observations and Models, Classifications of Young Stars
- [Determining Stellar Properties of Young Stars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lizFKZIaz9k&list=PLIbTYGsIVYtgX3sMsSOOgfoaKPrNJGmA9&index=23)
- Accuracy of spectroscopic analysis 
  - See [NSO Solar Atlas](https://nso.edu/data/historical-archive/)
  - Stellar magnetic field must be determined because it biases spectra except for molecular signals. Optical star studies account for only the hot mass of a star.

- Challenges of Modeling Young Stars. Accumulation of errors causes modelling problems. 
  - Benchmark systems confirm the accuracy of model prediction, with mass and metallicity as inputs.
- Accretion history leading to idiosyncratic events like axis tilt of Uranus. "Outburst events" at boundary layers present major errors in models.
- Nonequilibrium chemistry characterizes the accretion disks
- Stellar luminosity changes lead to misclassification on HRD and radiation bursts agains forming planets, stripping water, atmospheres
